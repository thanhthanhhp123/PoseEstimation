# Sitting Posture Detection System

This project aims to develop a system that detects whether a person is sitting in a correct or incorrect posture using keypoints extracted from images or video streams. The system leverages Mediapipe for keypoint extraction and custom algorithms for classification based on the extracted data.

## Installation

To set up the project and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sitting-posture-detection.git
   cd sitting-posture-detection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` file includes all the necessary libraries such as OpenCV, Mediapipe, NumPy, and others for pose detection and machine learning tasks.

## Usage

1. **Keypoint Extraction:**
   The system uses MediaPipe to extract keypoints from the input images. You can use the `extract_keypoints` function to extract and normalize keypoints. Below is an example usage:

   ```python
   import cv2
   from utils import extract_keypoints

   image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"
   image = cv2.imread(image_path)
   keypoints = extract_keypoints(image)
   print(keypoints)  # A list of keypoints (x, y, visibility)
   ```

2. **Posture Detection:**
   To detect the posture, use the provided model (e.g., a deep learning classifier). Below is an example to predict the posture using the extracted keypoints:

   ```python
   from model import SittingPostureModel
   from utils import extract_keypoints

   # Initialize the model
   model = SittingPostureModel()

   # Load your image and extract keypoints
   image_path = "path_to_your_image.jpg"
   image = cv2.imread(image_path)
   keypoints = extract_keypoints(image)

   # Make a prediction
   prediction = model.predict(keypoints)
   print("Posture prediction:", "Correct" if prediction == 1 else "Incorrect")
   ```

3. **Run the system with video input:**
   If you want to run the system on video input and detect postures in real-time, use the following script:

   ```python
   import cv2
   from utils import extract_keypoints
   from model import SittingPostureModel

   # Initialize model
   model = SittingPostureModel()

   # Open video stream
   cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Use 0 for webcam or provide a file path for a video file

   while True:
       ret, frame = cap.read()
       if not ret:
           break

       # Extract keypoints from the frame
       keypoints = extract_keypoints(frame)

       if keypoints:
           # Make a prediction on the posture
           prediction = model.predict(keypoints)
           posture_text = "Correct" if prediction == 1 else "Incorrect"

           # Display the posture on the frame
           cv2.putText(frame, f"Posture: {posture_text}", (10, 30), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
           cv2.imshow("Posture Detection", frame)

       if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
           break

   cap.release()
   cv2.destroyAllWindows()
   ```

## Features

- **Real-time Posture Detection:** Detects whether a person is sitting in a correct or incorrect posture in real-time using a webcam or video file.
- **Keypoint Extraction:** Uses Mediapipe to extract 33 body keypoints from images or video frames.
- **Posture Classification:** Classifies sitting posture based on the extracted keypoints.
- **Confidence Thresholding:** Ensures that keypoints with low confidence are ignored for more accurate predictions.

## Training the Model

To train the posture detection model:

1. **Dataset Preparation:** Ensure your dataset contains images with labeled "true" (correct posture) and "false" (incorrect posture) classes.
2. **Model Architecture:** Use a suitable model architecture (e.g., a neural network) to learn posture patterns based on the keypoints.
3. **Training Script:** Train the model on the dataset with proper preprocessing, including keypoint normalization.

Example training code:
```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from dataset import PostureDataset
from model import SittingPostureModel

# Load the dataset
train_dataset = PostureDataset(root_dir="path_to_data", transform=your_transforms)
train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Initialize the model
model = SittingPostureModel()

# Define loss and optimizer
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    model.train()
    for batch in train_loader:
        # Process batch
        inputs, labels = batch
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(inputs)

        # Compute loss
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print(f"Epoch [{epoch + 1}/10], Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

### Notes:
- **Model Prediction:** This assumes you already have a trained model for posture classification (such as a neural network or SVM).
- **Dataset:** Make sure the dataset used for training contains labeled images with correct and incorrect sitting postures.
